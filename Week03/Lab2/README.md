** lab2.c - this is where your functions for lab2 goes.  DO NOT PUT YOUR TEST MAIN HERE!
* lab2main.c - this is where you write a main() function to test your program
* lab2practice.c - put the code for your functions for your extra practice problems here.  DO NOT PUT THE MAIN HERE!
* lab2practicemain.c - put the main() used for testing your practice problems here
